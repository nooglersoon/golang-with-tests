## Important Notes

### Defining Variables
We use := to declare and initializing variables which is short hard for both steps.

We use var name type to declare a variable with name and its type without initializing

### Function Name Convention

The function name starts with a lowercase letter.
In Go, public functions start with a capital letter and private ones start with a lowercase.

We don't want the internals of our algorithm to be exposed to the world, so we made this function private.
