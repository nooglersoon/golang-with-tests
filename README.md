## Important Notes

### Defining Variables
We use := to declare and initializing variables which is short hard for both steps.

We use var name type to declare a variable with name and its type without initializing

### Function Name Convention

The function name starts with a lowercase letter.
In Go, public functions start with a capital letter and private ones start with a lowercase.

We don't want the internals of our algorithm to be exposed to the world, so we made this function private.

### Benchmarking

When the benchmark code is executed, it runs b.N times and measures how long it takes.

The amount of times the code is run shouldn't matter to you, the framework will determine what is a "good" value for that to let you have some decent results.

### Arrays Initialization

Arrays have a fixed capacity which you define when you declare the variable. We can initialize an array in two ways:

[N]type{value1, value2, ..., valueN}
numbers := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

[...]type{value1, value2, ..., valueN}
numbers := [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

An interesting property of arrays is that the size is encoded in its type. If you try to pass an [4]int into a function that expects [5]int, it won't compile. They are different types so it's just the same as trying to pass a string into a function that wants an int.

### Range For Loop

range lets you iterate over an array. On each iteration, range returns two values - the index and the value. We are choosing to ignore the index value by using _ blank identifier.

### Slices

Go has slices which do not encode the size of the collection and instead can have any size.

Go does not let you use equality operators with slices.

You could write a function to iterate over each got and want slice and check their values but for convenience sake, we can use reflect.DeepEqual which is useful for seeing if any two variables are the same.

reflect.DeepEqual is not type safe at compile time!

### Test Coverage

It is important to question the value of your tests. It should not be a goal to have as many tests as possible, but rather to have as much confidence as possible in your code base.

Having too many tests can turn in to a real problem and it just adds more overhead in maintenance. Every test has a cost.

Whilst striving for 100% coverage should not be your end goal, the coverage tool can help identify areas of your code not covered by tests.

run go test -cover

### Struct
We can create a simple type using a struct. A struct is just a named collection of fields where you can store data.

### String Formatter
Use of g will print a more precise decimal number in the error message (fmt options). For example, using a radius of 1.5 in a circle area calculation, f would show 7.068583 whereas g would show 7.0685834705770345.

### Function Definition
Some programming languages allow you to have two function with same name but different parameters. But you cant do in go.

We have two choices:
- You can have functions with the same name declared in different packages. So we could create our Area(Circle) in a new package, but that feels overkill here.

- We can define methods on our newly defined types instead.

### Methods
A method is a function with a receiver. A method declaration binds an identifier, the method name, to a method, and associates the method with the receiver's base type.

Methods are very similar to functions but they are called by invoking them on an instance of a particular type. Where you can just call functions wherever you like, such as Area(rectangle) you can only call methods on "things".

### Interface
Interfaces are a very powerful concept in statically typed languages like Go because they allow you to make functions that can be used with different types and create highly-decoupled code whilst still maintaining type-safety.

Normally you have to write code to say My type Foo implements interface Bar.

In Go interface resolution is implicit. If the type you pass in matches what the interface is asking for, it will compile.

### Table Driven Tests
Table driven tests are useful when you want to build a list of test cases that can be tested in the same manner.

Table driven tests can be a great item in your toolbox, but be sure that you have a need for the extra noise in the tests. They are a great fit when you wish to test various implementations of an interface, or if the data being passed in to a function has lots of different requirements that need testing.


### Pointers

Pointers let us point to some values and then let us change them. So rather than taking a copy of the whole Wallet, we instead take a pointer to that wallet so that we can change the original values within it.

In Go, when you call a function or a method the arguments are copied.

When calling func (w Wallet) Deposit(amount int) the w is a copy of whatever we called the method from.
Without getting too computer-sciency, when you create a value - like a wallet, it is stored somewhere in memory. You can find out what the address of that bit of memory with &myVal.

Go copies values when you pass them to functions/methods, so if you're writing a function that needs to mutate state you'll need it to take a pointer to the thing you want to change.

The fact that Go takes a copy of values is useful a lot of the time but sometimes you won't want your system to make a copy of something, in which case you need to pass a reference. Examples include referencing very large data structures or things where only one instance is necessary (like database connection pools).

### Typealias swift on go

Go lets you create new types from existing ones.
The syntax is type MyName OriginalType

To make Bitcoin you just use the syntax Bitcoin(999).
By doing this we're making a new type and we can declare methods on them.

This can be very useful when you want to add some domain specific functionality on top of existing types.

### nil
nil is synonymous with null from other programming languages. Errors can be nil because the return type of Withdraw will be error, which is an interface. If you see a function that takes arguments or returns values that are interfaces, they can be nillable.

Like null if you try to access a value that is nil it will throw a runtime panic. This is bad! You should make sure that you check for nils.

Pointers can be nil

When a function returns a pointer to something, you need to make sure you check if it's nil or you might raise a runtime exception - the compiler won't help you here.

Useful for when you want to describe a value that could be missing

### t.Fatal

We've introduced t.Fatal which will stop the test if it is called. This is because we don't want to make any more assertions on the error returned if there isn't one around. Without this the test would carry on to the next step and panic because of a nil pointer.

### Errors

Errors are the way to signify failure when calling a function/method.

By listening to our tests we concluded that checking for a string in an error would result in a flaky test. So we refactored our implementation to use a meaningful value instead and this resulted in easier to test code and concluded this would be easier for users of our API too.

This is not the end of the story with error handling, you can do more sophisticated things but this is just an intro. Later sections will cover more strategies.

Donâ€™t just check errors, handle them gracefully
